🧠 **What I do**

I am a Software Engineer currently working at **Goldman Sachs**, building large scale backend and data platforms that power critical production workflows.

I focus on systems that must be  
reliable under pressure  
easy to operate  
safe by default  
and scalable without heroics  

I enjoy working close to the core of systems where performance, correctness, and ownership matter.

⚙️ **Engineering Principles I Care About**

• Clean and boring architecture that ages well  
• Strong ownership from design to production  
• Automation over manual processes  
• Observability and failure first thinking  
• Building software people trust at 3 AM
